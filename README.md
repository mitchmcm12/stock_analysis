XYZ Stock and Industry Peers uses pandas, numpy, yfinance, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly to scrape stock data from the web, manipulate that data in usable pandas
dataframes, and to give visuals of that stock data. After bringing in stocks that compete with XYZ stock and compiling them all into a portfolio, I created more visuals,
and used monte carlo simulation to optimize individual weights to obtain the max sharpe ratio. The jupyter notebook template can be used to plug in whatever stocks you
would like to put into a portfolio, and to simulate the weights to maximize the sharpe ratio of that new portfolio of stocks.


SimFin import and MLprep is another project done in jupyter notebook to import data from SimFin and begin to manipulate the data to be used for machine learning.
I pulled Mastercard stock out of the data randomly, but any stock of your choosing could be pulled out of the larger pandas DataFrame that I cleaned up and merged.


python practice portfolio optimization is, although similar to XYZ stock and industry peers, a more realistic and efficient template for analysis and portfolio optimization. I am going to keep XYZ stock and Industry Peers in the repository as a resource to track my progression/learning.
